# 📚 Quarter 1 Assignment Projects - Python 🐍

Welcome to my collection of beginner-friendly Python projects completed during Quarter 1! These mini-projects helped me strengthen my Python fundamentals, practice logic building, and explore web apps with Streamlit.

## 🚀 Projects Overview

### ✅ Project 1: Mad Libs Python Project
A fun project where the user inputs different words (like noun, verb, adjective), and the program inserts them into a pre-defined story to create a funny result.

### ✅ Project 2: Guess the Number Game (Computer Guesses)
In this version, the user thinks of a number, and the computer tries to guess it by using a smart guessing strategy (like binary search).

### ✅ Project 3: Guess the Number Game (User Guesses)
The computer randomly selects a number, and the user has to guess it with hints (too high, too low) until they get it right.

### ✅ Project 4: Rock, Paper, Scissors
A classic game where the user plays rock, paper, scissors against the computer with the result showing who wins each round.

### ✅ Project 5: Hangman Game
A word guessing game where the user guesses letters in a hidden word. With each wrong guess, part of the hangman is drawn.

### ✅ Project 6: Countdown Timer
A simple countdown timer where the user enters the number of seconds, and the timer counts down to zero with a time delay.

### ✅ Project 7: Password Generator
A program that generates strong, random passwords based on user input like length and type (letters, digits, special characters).

### ✅ Project 8: BMI Calculator Web App (Streamlit)
A sleek and simple BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator built using Streamlit that lets users input their weight and height to get their BMI instantly.

### ✅ Project 9: Python Website With Streamlit in 15 Minutes
A beginner-friendly website built using Streamlit that demonstrates how easy and fast it is to create interactive web applications with Python.
